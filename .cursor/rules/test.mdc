# Test Guidelines

- Use Vitest for testing: `pnpm test` or `vitest run`
- Use `test()` instead of `describe()` + `it()` for test cases
- Test files should be named with the `.test.ts` extension
- Place test files next to the files they test
- Use the `expect()` API for assertions
- Test coverage should be comprehensive for all tools
- Mock external dependencies like file system operations and CLI commands
- For testing MCP tools, ensure proper validation of input/output schemas
